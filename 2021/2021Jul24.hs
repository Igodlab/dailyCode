-- Given an array with n objects colored red, white or blue, sort them in-place so that objects of the same color are adjacent, with the colors in the order red, white and blue.
-- 
-- Here, we will use the integers 0, 1, and 2 to represent the color red, white, and blue respectively.
-- 
-- Note: You are not suppose to use the libraryâ€™s sort function for this problem.
-- 
-- Can you do this in a single pass?
-- 
-- Example:
-- Input: [2,0,2,1,1,0]
-- Output: [0,0,1,1,2,2]
-- Here's a starting point:

instance Eq Colors where
    Red == Red     = True
    White == White = True
    Blue == Blue   = True

instance Ord Colors where
    Red `compare` Red     = EQ
    Red `compare` White   = LT
    Red `compare` Blue    = LT

    White `compare` White = EQ
    White `compare` Red   = GT
    White `compare` Blue  = LT

    Blue `compare` Red    = GT
