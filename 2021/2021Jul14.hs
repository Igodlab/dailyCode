-- You have a landscape, in which puddles can form. You are given an array of non-negative integers representing the elevation at each location. Return the amount of water that would accumulate if it rains.
-- 
-- For example: [0,1,0,2,1,0,1,3,2,1,2,1] should return 6 because 6 units of water can get trapped here.
